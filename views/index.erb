        <h2 id='about'>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am an ambitious full stack developer. After completing a Maths degree, I spent a few years tutoring 
          Maths and Physics, travelling and learning about music. I then started working for Pwc in a tax technology 
          consulting graduate role. However having found no joy or satisfaction in that job, I began to learn to 
          code and found it really enjoyable. So when I heard about Makers, I left that role to try and become a 
          software developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I began to code last year, I couldn't believe what I'd been missing out on. Suddenly I had a career 
          path that could be a hobby as well. Coding really satisfies my need for creativity and problem solving, 
          and is everything I'd hoped my Maths degree would be. I love that the skills you pick up have real world 
          applications, and the immediacy of seeing the code you type become the product on screen. The idea of 
          having this blank canvas and all the tools and languages available to me, with all the learning resources 
          available online to master them, is something I find incredibly exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started the course at Makers in October and have learnt many of the cornerstones of what it
          is to be a good coder. With a heavy focus on test driven development, debugging and not just how
          to use one language, but gaining an understanding of what it is that defines a programming language. I now 
          feel confident that I can pick up any programming language in a short space of time and have the 
          necessary skills to add value to your team of developers.

        <h3>Self Motivator</h3>
        <p>
          I believe I am excellent at motivating myself and having the persistence to learn any skill I need to. This 
          is something I struggled with as a teenager, but I really developed in this area during uni when I taught 
          myself how to play guitar. I created a routine that I made sure I did everyday consisting of skills I needed 
          to get better at. Something that was so important in this process was making sure I persisted even in the 
          moments where it seemed I wasn't getting any better. Fighting through these moments really taught me the 
          importance of persistence and overcoming self doubt.
        </p>
        <h3>Simplifying Complex Topics</h3>
        <p>
          During my time as a Maths and Physics tutor much of my success was based on my ability to explain complex 
          topics in a simple way. My aim was to translate the materials we were studying in order to demistify the 
          students belief that certain topics were beyond them. I explained things in plain English, trying to use as 
          few mathematical terms as possible. I also made sure to show them multiple examples and slowly go through them 
          as well, as I believe that the most important phase of learning something new is when we put the skill into practice.

        <h3>Chitter</h3>
        <p>
          This is a micro-blogging website solo project I made whilst following the test driven development process. The 
          technologies I used included Ruby, Sinatra, Jquery and Bcrypt. I used Rspec and Capybara for the testing.<br>

          I am a self taught guitarist and love learning new music and playing with friends.
          I enjoy playing football, tennis, table tennis and snooker and regularly go to local 
          snooker clubs with friends to remind us how bad we are. I also really enjoy cooking and regularly cook
          for friends and family. I'm also a bit mad about video gaming, and will gladly organize then 
          win mario kart tournaments to help raise team morale.
